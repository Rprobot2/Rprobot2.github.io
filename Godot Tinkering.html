										<h1>Godot Tinkering</h1>
									</header>
									<p>I started to use Godot in 2018.  I had tried out Unity, Unreal Engine and Gamemaker and they were all overcomplicated.  I continued to look for game engines, and eventually I stumbled upon Godot.  It's open source (which is great), but it also has a fantastic implementation of class hierarchies.  It's been fun to use and I've made many projects in it - note that I haven't finished any yet.  I've created 4 different half-finished games in it, but unfortunately with the death of my laptop I've lost the files.  Fortunately, I have backups of the game that my friends and I were working on.</p>
                                    
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Godot Tinkering/knight.png" alt="" /></span>We hadn't come close to finishing it yet, but rather we were simply developing it.  The sprites are mostly temporary, so take them with a grain of salt.  In terms of progress that I had made, I had created an ability system which applies 'effects' to entities - these 'effects' automatically delete themselves once they are supposed to expire, and can take a multitude of forms.  For example, they could be a healing potion, a healing circle, poison, a damaging projectile, a dash, etc.  I had also implemented an ability system for the characters.  As of yet I have created one of the three different classes.  I made all my code modular so that whenever I created a new entity or character I can simply edit variables and make a few new functions.</p>
                                        
                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Godot%20Tinkering/Pink_ROCK.png" alt="" /></span>The one class that I was creating was the 'Druid'.  The Druid has a special focus on healing the team.  The abilities that I implemented were the 'dash', where the Druid has a fixed velocity in the direction of the mouse cursor for a set amount of time, while also being unable to move during this time.  As well, I had a 'healing circle' which would apply healing whenever the character walked into it.</p>
                                    
									<p>After implementing those two abilities, it was time to make a framework for enemies.  Initially the Godot implementation of A* navigation was dysfunctional, however I eventually managed to make it work.  The enemies could then navigate toward you, around obstacles, whenever you were within a fixed distance.  I had also implemented a health bar, which (temporarily) was just a modified progress bar.  There was also a character health bar, based on points, which would have individual tiles changing their sprite in order to indicate their individual health.</p>
